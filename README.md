## Description

Shopping-UnitTesting is a simple Android application for creating a list of shopping items that need to be purchased and storing them in a Room database. It utilizes **Kotlin**, **Navigation UI**, **Coroutines**, **Hilt Dependency Injection**, **MVVM architecture**, **Room Database**, **Unit Testing**, and the **PixaBay API** for fetching images of the items. The main focus of this repository is on demonstrating best practices for unit testing in Android applications.

### Technologies Used:
